/* X11 has a weakness when it comes to clipboard handling,
 * there is no way to get told when the owner of the clipboard
 * changes. This is often needed, for instance to set the
 * sensitivity of the paste menu item. We work around this
 * internally in an app by telling the clipboard monitor when
 * we changed the clipboard. Unfortunately this doesn't give
 * us perfect results, we still don't catch changes made by
 * other clients
 *
 * This is fixed with the XFIXES extensions, which recent versions
 * of Gtk+ supports as the owner_change signal on GtkClipboard. We
 * use this now, but keep the old code since not all X servers support
 * XFIXES.
